Orthogonal lattice structure in Haskell
---------------------------------------

**IMPORTANT:** This repository is now [hosted on BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/jstolarek/lattice-structure-hs).

This repository contains my failed attempt at implementing parallel orthogonal
lattice structure in Haskell. I'm making my work public in hope that someone
might be able to solve the problems I was unable to solve. See
[this blog post](http://lambda.jstolarek.com/2014/05/parallel-haskell-challange-also-how-to-make-your-research-project-fail/)
for more information.

The source code is mostly without commentary. This means that you need to
contact me if there is something you don't understand. I will gladly answer any
questions.
